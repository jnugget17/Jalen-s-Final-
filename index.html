      <h1>Washington D.C. Is No Longer the "Chocoalate City" It Once Was</h1>

        <p>About three years ago in the spring of 2019 there was a controversy taking place at the HBCU, Howard University. Just in case you forgot about what happened and you need a reminder, there was a lot of outrage at a person who was walking their dog because it was seen to be disrespectful by treating an HBCU campus as some casual stroll through the park. However, it was never about the dog. All this problem did was highlight a much bigger problem in the nation’s capital. Washington D.C., which was once known as “Chocolate City”, can no longer take claim to this nickname.</p>
        <p>The African American population in Washington D.C. has been on a steady decline in the recent years and it shows no sign of stopping. This trend can be coupled with a number of factors, including but not limited to, gentrification, the high cost of living, and the migration of African Americans to the suburbs.</p>

        <iframe title="Population percentage of each race in Washington D.C." aria-label="Multiple Pies" id="datawrapper-chart-OemmN" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OemmN/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="279" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
        <p>Gentrification has played a very significant role in the decrease of the African American population in Washington D.C. Gentrification in its simplest terms is the process by which affluent people migrate to low-income urban neighborhoods, which will often lead to the displacement of the original residents. In Washington D.C., the process of gentrification has been taking place at an alarming rate with low-income neighborhoods going through significant changes that causes the area around it to become more expensive over time. For example, during my time at Howard University and my walks through the city, I noticed that on the same street there would be houses that were not in the best shape, but five seconds later I will see a house that was somewhat brand-new or greatly innovated.</p>
        <p>Because of these new houses and innovations, the neighborhood of course becomes more desirable and expensive, forcing African Americans to move out since they can no longer afford the housing. What we have called home for many years is now being taken away and this is not the only factor driving the African American population outside of D.C.</p>
        <p>Another reason why the African American population in D.C. is decreasing is because of the high cost of living. According to several websites and study done by Numbeo (a large database), D.C. consistently ranks in the top 5 to top 4 most expensive places to live in the United States. As a matter of fact the cost of living in D.C. is about +12 the national average. Because of this, African Americans rent houses more than they own compared to white poeple in D.C. This will make it most difficult for African Americans to keep up with these harsh conditions and as a result they will move to the suburbs where living is much more affordable.</p>
         <img src="chart.png">
         <iframe title="Percent of owner and renter occupied housing in Washington D.C. for African American and white people from 2016-2021." aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-CpjCS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CpjCS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="987" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
        <p>The migration to the suburbs is yet another reason why the African American population is declining in Washington D.C. Not only are there a myriad options for better and more affordable housing opportunities, the schools in the area also have a chance of providing the same or even a better education than a school in D.C. There are also more aspects that can come into play. Prince George’s County, currently the second most affluent majority-black county in the country, can provide a better sense of security and connection for African Americans, especially ones that were forced to relocate from D.C.</p> 
        <p>However, simply moving to the suburbs or any other area does not solve the problem that D.C. faces. The decrease in the African American population tells a much bigger problem. That is the problem of how African Americans may eventually see an erasure of the historical and cultural impact that they have had on the city. From institutes such as Howard University to the genre of go-go music, the D.C. African American population has brought significant diversity, vibrance, and lessons to the city. The decrease in the African American population threatens to undermine this importance and shifting to an entirely different culture and history.</p>
        <p>It goes beyond D.C as well. The decrease also has bigger implications for the rest of the United States. African Americans have been and will continue to be a significant part of the country and how we are represented through the social, economic, and political status of the country. But, if the African American population is already decreasing in the nations capital, what does that spell for other places in the United States where black people were undermined since the establishment of said place? It comes into question whether progress is being made or if the nations is regressing instead. While D.C. is FAR from the only place where black people have cultural significance, it can be said that racial equality and social justice is far from being seen.</p>
        <p>Overall, the decrease in the African American population in Washington D.C. is a complex issue that you can’t just look at from a number’s standpoint. It involves several factors such as gentrification, affordable housing, and the migration to the suburb because of the high cost of living. As stated before this trend implies a much grander scale in regards to the entire nation and it is vital for lawmakers and political figures to address this issue so that African Americans will continue to spread life throughout D.C.</p>
